# Collecting Data Sensibly


### Observational Study
- **Observing** data from a sample to gain insight into population characteristics.

### Variables in a Study
- **Response Variable**: The focus of the study or experiment. **Dependent Variable**
- **Explanatory Variable**: Explains changes in the response variable. **Independent Variable**

A study is interested in how variability in x affects y, **x** is **Explanatory Variable**, **y** is **Response Variable**

### Experiments
- **Observing the behavior** of response variables when **explanatory variables are manipulated.**
- **Experimental Conditions**: treatments

  Both observational studies and experiments can be used to compare groups, but **only** in an **experiment** the researcher can **controls** who is in which group

### Cause-and-Effect
- Difficult to draw clear cause-and-effect conclusions in observational studies due to **confounding variables**.
- **well-designed Experiments** can provide evidence for cause-and-effect relationships.

### Sampling and Bias
- **Selection Bias**: **Undercoverage**.Systematic exclusion of parts of the population.
- **Measurement or Response Bias**: Method of observation producing systematically different values.(machine used for measurements is not calibrated properly / Survey questions biased, leads you to a specific answer...)
- **Non-response Bias**: when responses are not obtained from all individuals in sample.

### Random Sampling
- **Simple Random Sample**: **Every possible sample of size n** has an **equal chance** of being selected.(n denotes sample size).is a sampling method **free of selection bias.**
- **Sampling without Replacement**: Once selected, an individual cannot be selected again.
- **Sampling with Replacement**: Individuals can be selected more than once.

### Sample Size n
- Small sample sizes can **accurately reflect** the population when **randomly selected**.

### Other Sampling Methods
- **Stratified Random Sampling**: Sampling from **non-overlapping** subgroups(strata).
- **Cluster Sampling**: Selecting entire clusters and including all individuals within them.
- **Systematic Sampling**: Selecting every k-th individual in a sequence after a random start.
- **Convenience Sampling**: Selecting individuals based on convenience, which can introduce bias.
