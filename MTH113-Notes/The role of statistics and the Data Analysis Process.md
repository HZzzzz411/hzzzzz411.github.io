# **The role of statistics and the Data Analysis Process**
## Important Definition
1.**Population**：entire collection of sth which information is desired

2.**Sample**：subset of the population, selected for study

3.**Descriptive statistics**：a branch of statistics that includes methods for **organizing** and **summarizing** data.

4.**Inferential statistics**：a branch of statistics that involves **generalizing** from a sample to the population 

## **Types of Data**：
1.**Univariate Dataset**: observations on a single characteristic.

2.**Bivariate Dataset**:two characteristics.

3.**Multivariate Dataset**: multiple characteristics.

4.**Categorical Dataset**: **qualitative**. categorical responses.
   
5.**Numerical Dataset**: **quantitative**. each observation is a number.

### Categorical Data：Frequency Distribution and Bar Chart
  - **Frequency distribution table**: A common way to present categorical data 
  - **Frequency**: The **number of times** a category appears in the dataset.
    
  - **Relative Frequency**: The proportion of observations that belong to a particular category.
    
     $$\boxed{ Relative Frequency = \frac{Frequency}{number of obervations in the data set}}$$
    
- **Bar Chart**: A graph of a frequency distribution for **categorical data**.The **area** of each bar **is proportional** to the corresponding frequency or relative frequency.

### Numerical Data ：Dotplots
- **Discrete Numerical Variable**: discrete data , possible values correspond to **isolated points** on the number line.
  
- **Continuous Numerical Variable**:  continuous data , possible values forms an **entire interval** on the number line.
  
- **Dotplots**：Describe the frequency distribution for **numerical data**, suitable for small numerical datasets.
