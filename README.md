# MTH113 Notes

# **The role of statistics and the Data Analysis Process**
## Important Definition
1.**Population**：entire collection of sth which information is desired

2.**Sample**：subset of the population, selected for study

3.**Descriptive statistics**：a branch of statistics that includes methods for **organizing** and **summarizing** data.

4.**Inferential statistics**：a branch of statistics that involves **generalizing** from a sample to the population 

## **Types of Data**：
1.**Univariate Dataset**: observations on a single characteristic.

2.**Bivariate Dataset**:two characteristics.

3.**Multivariate Dataset**: multiple characteristics.

4.**Categorical Dataset**: **qualitative**. categorical responses.
   
5.**Numerical Dataset**: **quantitative**. each observation is a number.

### Categorical Data：Frequency Distribution and Bar Chart
  - **Frequency distribution table**: A common way to present categorical data 
  - **Frequency**: The **number of times** a category appears in the dataset.
    
  - **Relative Frequency**: The proportion of observations that belong to a particular category.
    
     $$\boxed{ Relative Frequency = \frac{Frequency}{number of obervations in the data set}}$$
    
- **Bar Chart**: A graph of a frequency distribution for **categorical data**.The **area** of each bar **is proportional** to the corresponding frequency or relative frequency.

### Numerical Data ：Dotplots
- **Discrete Numerical Variable**: discrete data , possible values correspond to **isolated points** on the number line.
  
- **Continuous Numerical Variable**:  continuous data , possible values forms an **entire interval** on the number line.
  
- **Dotplots**：Describe the frequency distribution for **numerical data**, suitable for small numerical datasets.
  

# Collecting Data Sensibly


### Observational Study
- **Observing** data from a sample to gain insight into population characteristics.

### Variables in a Study
- **Response Variable**: The focus of the study or experiment. **Dependent Variable**
- **Explanatory Variable**: Explains changes in the response variable. **Independent Variable**

A study is interested in how variability in x affects y, **x** is **Explanatory Variable**, **y** is **Response Variable**

### Experiments
- **Observing the behavior** of response variables when **explanatory variables are manipulated.**
- **Experimental Conditions**: treatments

  Both observational studies and experiments can be used to compare groups, but **only** in an **experiment** the researcher can **controls** who is in which group

### Cause-and-Effect
- Difficult to draw clear cause-and-effect conclusions in observational studies due to **confounding variables**.
- **well-designed Experiments** can provide evidence for cause-and-effect relationships.

### Sampling and Bias
- **Selection Bias**: **Undercoverage**.Systematic exclusion of parts of the population.
- **Measurement or Response Bias**: Method of observation producing systematically different values.(machine used for measurements is not calibrated properly / Survey questions biased, leads you to a specific answer...)
- **Non-response Bias**: when responses are not obtained from all individuals in sample.

### Random Sampling
- **Simple Random Sample**: **Every possible sample of size n** has an **equal chance** of being selected.(n denotes sample size).is a sampling method **free of selection bias.**
- **Sampling without Replacement**: Once selected, an individual cannot be selected again.
- **Sampling with Replacement**: Individuals can be selected more than once.

### Sample Size n
- Small sample sizes can **accurately reflect** the population when **randomly selected**.

### Other Sampling Methods
- **Stratified Random Sampling**: Sampling from **non-overlapping** subgroups(strata).
- **Cluster Sampling**: Selecting entire clusters and including all individuals within them.
- **Systematic Sampling**: Selecting every k-th individual in a sequence after a random start.
- **Convenience Sampling**: Selecting individuals based on convenience, which can introduce bias.
